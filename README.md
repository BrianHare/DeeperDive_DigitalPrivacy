These are the slides that formed the presentation, along with a list of background reading, other materials, and a far-from-comprehensive resource guide. If you want to explore even further, I recommend starting with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (https://www.eff.org/). Privacy International (https://www.privacyinternational.org/) is a UK-based organization working in this space as well; while I do not endorse all of their policy prescriptions, I have yet to find a factual error on their site. 

And I should once again emphasize: This presentation was about the problems, abuses, and drawbacks of this technology. Data mining is allowing us to do amazing things. But it comes at a cost, and that cost is higher than most realize.
